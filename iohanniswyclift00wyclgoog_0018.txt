to XV) is a more detailed attack on the accident-theory: going through
many classes 01 accidents, Wyclil asserts that none can be absolute
in the sense required. Chapters XV and XVI seem to be a written
reply to some treatise or treatises composed against him. He carelully
goes over all the authorities quoted by his adversaries, explains their
meaning agreeably to his own views, and adds several very important
remarks concerning his doctrine. Ch. XVll is principally a historical
review 01 the institution 01 the Mass. 01 course there is not a single
chapter in which something extrinsical, either concerning the Friars,
Church temporalities, or the power 01 the Pope, does not occur3
but as l said before, unless something particularly worthy 01 notice
comes to hand, 1 am obliged to confine mysell to the main question
and to overlook repetitions.

lt is necessary to offer a lew remarks as to the dogma 01
Transsubstantiation, and the philosophical theories connected therewith
in the Catholic Church. Scholastic theologians were from the beginning

t in lace ola universal belief in the real presence 01 Christ's Body in
the Holy Eucharist; and that belief was borne out by the written tra·

, dition, both 01 the Fathers, 01 the Apostle Paul, and 01 the Gospels them-
selves. Here adifliculty occurred: the bread seemed to remain, assuredly3
but it it remained really, how could Christ's body be really there?
Nothing can be where it was not before, unless by a change 01 place,
or by conversion 01 something else into itsell.1 T herefore, as Christ
does not leave Heaven, the bread itself, remaining to all the senses
as it was before, is changed into Christ's body; the substance, or as
we might perhaps call it, the rrournenon alone is changed, all the
phenomena are what they were (Aq. S. Th. qu. 75, art. a) This is
a lresh mystery, which also requires to be explained: 101 how can
appearances possibly exist, without anything that appears?

There is here a split amongst Catholic philosophers. The
Scholastics answered the question thus: Every accident, while belonging
to the substance, possesses a certain amount 01 reality, of entity,
which is different from the latter, a beot finger being really different
from a finger that is straight, that which makes the difference must

¹This axiom Wyclif (p. 186, 1. a) is constrained to call heretical3 101 it is
evidently in contradiction with his system, as we shall see.
