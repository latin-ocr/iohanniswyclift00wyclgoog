relative to the Holy Trinity, as in the Lateran Council, he would have
done better to have let the matter alone, and contented himself with
reforming the Church. lt were blasphemy to say that all decrees ol
the Roman Pontiff are infallible3 if he goes beyond Scripture, he is
probably wrong. The antiquity, sanctity and science ol the Roman See
proves nothingus to infallibility (pp. 68—74). Notwithstanding the
violent language that Wyclil very often employs with regard to the
Roman Curia, and his evident disbeliel in the dogma ol infallibility,
he generally admits the Decretals as binding, and even (p. 175) speaks
vaguely ol admitting the decislon of a general Council on the
Eucharistic question. Still, his principle ol the necessity of personal
righteousness (or rather of predestinatam), ol which we never can be
certain, to constitute a true Prien, Bishop or Pope, strikes at the root
of all belief as to th'e infallibility even of a general Council; for we
are never sure whether all — or even any - ol the members ol a
Council are members of the Church at all. Should they decide
in our favour, we might indeed believe that they were; but if they
decide against us, they cannot be members of the Church. This shows
that, though widely different in its starting·point and first principles
from the Protestant forms of thought that had so much vogue at a
later period, Wyctits system is no less antagonistic in practice to the
authority of the Church. Wyclil says explicitly: We must obey the
Head of the Church, the Vicar ol Christ. But that Vicar of Christ
is the holiest, the most God-enlightened man in Christendom; which
the Popes are certainly not. Ι
Ch. Vl. One objection against the reality ol the presence ascribed
by Wyclif to the power of the sign, is that Christ would be equally
present in Holy Writ, which is His Word and His manifestation.
The answer is not hard to find; there can be no equality, afrer
Christ’s express declaration. Any bread might be taken as the sign

ol Christ's Body (spiritual food); but “not every bread is consecrated
with a mystic prayer'', as Augustine says. ll the argument rau
otherwise, however3 if Wyclil were asked whether any piece of breed,
looked at by a Christian as the image of Christ, food of our souls,
would be not equally but really Christ's Body, he would, l believe,
have had consistently to answer in the affirmative. To point out this
more clearly by an illustration, the Crucilix ought to be adored on
