lNTRODUCTlON.

I.

l may now briefly describe the six MSS, from indications kindly
supplied by Dr. Herzberg·Fr{incltel, of the Imperial Library, Vienna,
who transcribed the work, and by the various collators. And here
Iwish to acknowledge the great pains taken both by the transcriber
and the collators, which has considerably lightencd my tasi, though
l did not think it worth while to preserve all the various readings.
Some presented only a philological or palaeographic interest; most
of these have been set aside. They become much rarer after the
end of the second chapter, when both E and F are wanting3 it is
unfortunate, as these two seem to have been copied from sources in·
dependent of the rest, and often give us the right sense when the
others are at fault. Many a doubtful sentence would probably have
been explained, had these been complete. The readings of C and D
are comparatively the least useful3 B serves on many occasions to
supplement the text of A.

A belongs to the sarne collection as the MS. of Poole’s De
Dominio Civili, and his general description of that MS. may be
applied to this. The title of the work, in red inlr, on f. 37, runs
thus: Incipit tractatus de apostasia, liber XI (meaning that it is the
eleventh book of Wyclif's Summa leeolopica). At the end, on f. 124,
there are the words: Explicit tractatus de apostasia magistri Johannis
Wiclef doctoris ewangelici. This is written in the same hand as the
text. Lower down, there is: Respice finem, 1517, in a later hand,
followed by some cyphered writing, perhaps the owner's name, or
some indications relative to the scribe himself. The handwriting and
other external peculiarities of the MS. are identical with those of
the Nimburg collection, near Kolin, in Bohemia.

B. Paper, each sextern enclosed in leaf of parchment; binding,
leather and boards. At the beginning, inside the cover, stands an
index of the works contained in the volume, in XV¹h century writing:
a proof that the binding dates at least as far back. Beneath, there is
written: A fructibus eorum cognoscetis eor. De Blasferaia, cap015
substancialiter corporaliter ibi corpus Christi. These words are the
same as a marginal note on f. 201. One date in the volume (1453,
Assumpcionis) points to the middle of the XV¹¹¹ century as the time
